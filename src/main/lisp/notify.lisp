;;;; Trivial application notification framework for condition handling

;; FIXME: 
;;
;; ;; 0) Document how this <framework> is used within DO-RECORDED-TEST
;;
;;       Towards that regard, an initial summary about the APPLICATION system:
;;
;;        1. [AFFTA] represents the first usage case for this
;;           application notification framework. 
;;
;;           In the origins of this framework's first application
;;           within AFFTA, it was observed: That if an _error_, _warning_,
;;           or other unhandled _condition_ occurs during the
;;           application of a _test protocol_, it may be both feasible
;;           and supportive to the application developer, to ensure
;;           that the developer would be notified of the _condition_ --
;;           moreover, that not only may the _notification_ object
;;           include a representation of the _condition_ object - as
;;           would be in a format appropriate to the respective
;;           _notification media_ - but that furthermore, the
;;           _notification_ object may include a representation of a
;;           single _context object_ indicating the origin of the
;;           _condition_ object.
;;
;;          In the initial development of this application
;;          notification protocol, it was observed that the class NULL
;;          may serve as a  convenient designator for a "null
;;          application" -- as in a context in which an application's
;;          development is essentially being conducted, informally, by
;;          way of direct stream I/O onto a locally accessible Common
;;          Lisp implementation.
;;
;;          This notification protocol may serve as a component of a
;;          system for supporting application design within an
;;          integrated development environment, and may be furthermore
;;          extended for appliation within a server environment.
;;           
;;
;; 1) Move this into a new 'application' system [MCi]
;;
;; 2) Document NOTIFY [standard generic function]
;;
;; 3) Describe %APPLICATION% [Variable]
;;
;; 4.A) Extend this siple framework for an appliation system such that
;;      would be running within an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic
;;      Compute Cloud (EC2) _instance_, and therefore would be able to
;;      utilize the AWS notifications API - namely, as for notifying
;;      an application's maintainer and/or maintenance staff of any
;;      conditions observed within the Common Lisp appliation's
;;      runtime environment(w/ a top priority notification) 
;;      any error conditions, if not also (w/ a less priority
;;      notification) warning conditions occurring within the Common
;;      Lisp application's environment on the server - cf. also
;;      Nagios, Daemontools' Multilog, and SystemD, as in a context of
;;      server (if not also desktop) shell intefaces, as well as (in a
;;      Java server domain) Tomcat, Glassfish, and Liferay
;;      
;; 4.B) Extend this simple framework for a build system
;;      utilizing Hudson[1][2][3] within Fusion Forge[4][5][6][7]
;;      [Java] as in which an %application% would be:
;;
;;         1. In a development domain, an object of functional
;;            testing in a context of continuous integration[8]
;;
;;         2. In a resource management and resource distribution
;;            domain, an object for distribution e.g. to individual
;;            Maven, Debian, Cygwin, and other package repositories,
;;            as in a context of continuous delivery[8]
;;
;;         3. Once distributed, then an object for "issue tracking"
;;            such as with regards to individual issue tracking
;;            services utilized within indivudal Linux distributions
;;            (cf. Debian's 'reportbug' interface and broader issue
;;            tracking system), and  desktop environments (e.g. KDE
;;            and GNOME) as well as within individual applications 
;;            (e.g. Firefox, Google Chrome, and applications developed
;;            as components of the respective desktop environment,
;;            e.g. WebKit) in a context of developer support, if not
;;            moreover in a context of service customer support and
;;            overall customer fulfillment
;;
;;         4. In a  _network services domain_, an object running on
;;            one or more _application hosts_, such that would be
;;            _managed_ -- directly and/or indirectly -- by a
;;            developer developing this software, likewise cf. AWS,
;;            furthermore cf. DeLorme inReach
;;
;; 4.C) Illustrate how this simple generic function may be applied
;;      within each of
;;
;;     A) a desktop %application% using Garnet
;;
;;     B) an HTTP server %application% using Alexandria and/or CL-HTTP
;;
;;     C) an Eclpse IDE extension using ABCL and/or {CL+J, FOIL, ...}
;;        in which the %application% may represent simply an interface
;;        onto the Eclipse IDE - as the Eclipse IDE being, from the
;;        perspective of the Commonn Lisp peer, a _Java Application_ [Java]
;;
;;     D) then define CORBA IDL for Nr. C, and extend as at least a
;;        simple (?) CORBA-integrated message passing / application
;;        notification framework for Common Lisp peer applications
